# Release Notes

## Version 3.1.2 (2026-07-28)

### Highlights
- Includes the AFFiNE 0.27+ refreshable native-session authentication introduced in 3.1.1.
- Builds the architecture-independent application on the native build platform and assembles compatible amd64 and ARM64 runtime images without emulating the TypeScript build.

### Validation Evidence
- Authentication session regression suite
- Metadata, documentation, tool-manifest, and package verification
- Multi-platform container release build

## Version 3.1.1 (2026-07-28)

### Highlights
- Restores write-capable authentication against self-hosted AFFiNE 0.27+ without relying on the removed legacy personal-access-token API.
- Email/password deployments now obtain refreshable native access tokens and rotate them automatically for long-running MCP processes.
- Older cookie-based AFFiNE deployments continue to work without an extra sign-in request.

### Compatibility
- No tools or tool inputs changed.
- Existing `AFFINE_EMAIL` and `AFFINE_PASSWORD` configuration is reused; no refresh token needs to be stored.
- `AFFINE_COOKIE` and compatible bearer-token configurations continue to work unchanged.

### Validation Evidence
- Authentication session regression suite, including concurrent refresh rotation
- Metadata, documentation, and tool-manifest verification
- TypeScript build and package validation

## Version 3.1.0 (2026-07-27)

### Highlights
- Workspace discovery now returns best-effort profile names, avatar references, direct URLs, and explicit profile status without changing the existing top-level result shape.
- Self-hosted email/password authentication is more reliable on AFFiNE 0.27.3 because environment credentials override stale saved authentication and every HTTP path sends the required client-version header.
- Document deletion now recognizes AFFiNE 0.27.3 success acknowledgements and hides only confirmed deletions while upstream indexes converge.

### What Changed
- Workspace discovery
  - `list_workspaces` and `get_workspace` enrich GraphQL results with profile metadata when available.
  - `list_workspaces` accepts `includeProfile: false` for a faster GraphQL-only response.
  - Profile lookup failures are isolated per workspace instead of failing the entire result.
- Authentication and compatibility
  - Added `AFFINE_CLIENT_VERSION` with a default of `0.26.0` and send `x-affine-version` on sign-in, GraphQL, REST, CLI, and readiness requests.
  - `AFFINE_WS_CLIENT_VERSION` now falls back to `AFFINE_CLIENT_VERSION`, while explicit case-insensitive header overrides replace the default without duplicate values.
  - Environment authentication is resolved as one credential group, preventing saved tokens, cookies, or authentication headers from masking client-provided email/password credentials.
  - MCP Inspector setup guidance now explains how to load a named Claude Desktop server configuration.
- Document lifecycle
  - `delete_doc` accepts top-level and nested success acknowledgements returned by current AFFiNE servers.
  - Successfully acknowledged deletions are filtered from stale document listings without hiding unrelated orphan documents.
  - Acknowledged deletion tombstones expire after ten minutes and retain at most 10,000 entries.
- Workspace URLs
  - Newly created workspaces use the same canonical AFFiNE origin resolver as workspace discovery, including deployments with custom GraphQL paths.
- Dependencies and security
  - Updated `jose` from 6.2.3 to 6.2.4.
  - Refreshed locked HTTP and URI parser dependencies and cleared the current high-severity `fast-uri` audit finding.

### Compatibility
- No tools were removed and no existing input is required to change.
- Node.js 20 or newer remains required.
- Operators can override `AFFINE_CLIENT_VERSION` when an AFFiNE deployment requires a newer minimum client version.

### Validation Evidence
- `npm run ci`
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`
- `npm run test:comprehensive`
- `AFFINE_REVISION=0.27.3 npm run test:e2e`
- package smoke test and `npm publish --dry-run --access public --ignore-scripts`

## Version 3.0.1 (2026-07-21)

### Highlights
- Markdown import and export now preserve AFFiNE inline LinkedPage references, allowing linked-page relationships to round-trip safely through Markdown.

### What Changed
- Valid `[label](LinkedPage:<docId>)` links import as native inline references instead of broken URL links.
- Exported native references serialize back to the same `LinkedPage:` Markdown scheme.
- Standalone LinkedPage links remain paragraphs rather than being converted into invalid bookmark blocks.
- Added fast regression coverage for parsing, rendering, compatibility, and round-trip behavior.

### Validation Evidence
- `npm run ci`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- `npm run pack:check`

## Version 3.0.0 (2026-07-20)

### Highlights
- Updated the server for AFFiNE 0.27+ authentication and removed the obsolete personal-access-token tool family.
- Raised the minimum runtime to Node.js 20 and expanded CI coverage across the supported runtime range.
- Made tool failures, structured receipts, notification pagination, document moves, and destructive mutations fail closed with stable machine-readable contracts.
- Hardened Markdown import/export, external URL handling, blob uploads, HTTP exposure, OAuth service-account policy, and destructive live tests.
- Unified runtime, CLI, Docker, and HTTP configuration under one strict `environment > saved config > defaults` resolver.

### Breaking Changes and Migration
- The public surface is now 92 tools. `list_access_tokens`, `generate_access_token`, and `revoke_access_token` were removed because AFFiNE 0.27 removed the legacy GraphQL API behind them.
- For current self-hosted AFFiNE, configure `AFFINE_EMAIL` with `AFFINE_PASSWORD` or use `AFFINE_COOKIE`. For AFFiNE Cloud, use a Cookie request header from a signed-in browser session.
- `AFFINE_API_TOKEN` remains supported only when the target deployment accepts a compatible GraphQL bearer token.
- `affine-mcp login` now saves the authenticated session cookie and accepts an existing session through `--cookie`.
- Node.js 20 or newer is required.
- Permanent document, workspace, and blob cleanup operations require exact identifier confirmation, and several mutation and notification responses now use stricter structured contracts.

### What Changed
- Authentication and OAuth
  - Email/password authentication is process-scoped and single-flight across concurrent MCP sessions.
  - OAuth mode accepts email/password, session-cookie, or compatible bearer-token backend service credentials while keeping MCP caller identity separate.
  - OAuth deployments default to `read_only`; write-capable profiles require `AFFINE_OAUTH_ALLOW_SERVICE_WRITES=true`.
- Mutation and result safety
  - Tool errors now set MCP `isError: true` and include stable codes, retryability, and machine-readable context.
  - Document moves validate both ends, prevent cycles, preserve destination-first ordering, and report partial outcomes.
  - Document, workspace, blob, notification, and Markdown mutations no longer return success-shaped results for rejected or partial operations.
- Content and input hardening
  - Markdown export preserves supported rich-text attributes and escapes untrusted structure, destinations, frontmatter, fences, and table content.
  - URL-bearing blocks reject unsafe schemes, parser differentials, embedded credentials, and provider-host lookalikes before writing AFFiNE state.
  - Blob uploads enforce explicit binary encoding, decoded-size, timeout, response-size, and HTTP-status contracts.
  - Pagination, search, history, tree depth, destructive confirmation, and random identifier inputs now fail closed at their boundaries.
- Runtime and operations
  - CLI diagnostics and generated client snippets use the exact runtime configuration, including custom GraphQL paths and non-token credentials.
  - Document listing degrades unavailable AFFiNE `public` metadata to `null` with a warning instead of failing the entire result.
  - `/readyz` verifies the configured AFFiNE GraphQL endpoint and OAuth discovery when enabled.
  - HTTP runtime limits, shutdown behavior, CORS, remote bind policy, and bearer-token transport rules are validated strictly.
  - Docker E2E runs use isolated Compose projects, private generated credentials, scoped cleanup, and collision-resistant resource names.
- Release and dependency maintenance
  - Added manifest-driven test classification, package-smoke validation, release metadata and ancestry verification, and safe PR-route enforcement.
  - Updated GitHub Actions setup-node usage and refreshed locked TypeScript, Node.js type, and `tsx` development dependencies.

  - Aligned tag persistence to AFFiNE canonical schema (`meta.properties.tags.options`) by storing option IDs.
  - Added backward-compatible normalization for legacy string tag entries.
  - Added tag label resolution for tag-facing outputs (`read_doc`, `list_docs`, `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, markdown export).
- `tests/test-tag-visibility.mjs`, `tests/playwright/verify-tag-visibility.pw.ts`

- `src/tools/workspaces.ts`
  - Workspace bootstrap document blocks now use the same null-parent structure for consistency.
- `tests/test-database-creation.mjs`, `tests/test-bearer-auth.mjs`
  - Added explicit regression assertions for parent-shape parity after `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, and `create_doc_from_markdown`.

### Validation Evidence
- Local Docker AFFiNE validation passed for one-document full block coverage:
  - Created one document and appended all currently supported MCP block types.

## Version 1.2.0 (2025-09-16) 🚀

### 🎉 Highlights
- Document creation, editing, and deletion via WebSocket updates
- One-line install + run from npm: `npm i -g affine-mcp-server` → `affine-mcp`

### ✨ What's New
- `create_doc` – create a new doc (page/surface/note/paragraph minimal structure)
- `append_paragraph` – append a paragraph block (simple editing example)
- `delete_doc` – delete a doc and remove it from workspace list
- Supports both prefixed/non-prefixed tool names (`affine_*` and non-prefixed)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Applied NodeNext ESM resolution (stabilized relative `.js` imports)
- Improved SDK type consistency with MCP response format utilities
